## fraud_detector

This is a little web aplication that displays a fraud detection model at work. The web application is written to refresh every six seconds to mimic live transactions, 
this is done in order to view the models predictive abilities per transaction. The data row picked is randomly selected from the serialized dataset. Because the dataset is highly
unbalanced, most if not all of the randomly picked rows are none fraudulent transactions.

Note: This is part of an open source project I participated in, hence, the other web applications on the web page link are works done by other developers who participated in the OSP. [Link](https://github.com/kene111/g01-fraud-detection).
